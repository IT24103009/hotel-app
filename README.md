## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Step 1 — Install Dependencies

```bash
cd HotelManagementApp
npm install
```

If you get errors with `@react-native-picker/picker`, install it:
```bash
npx expo install @react-native-picker/picker
```

### Step 2 — Configure Your Backend URL

Open `src/config/api.js` and change `BASE_URL`:

```js
// Change this to your deployed backend URL
export const BASE_URL = 'https://20202257-dd04-40b8-aa4b-fe2d8c15fc1d-00-oci1sb6rtt5p.sisko.replit.dev/';
```

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** The backend MUST be hosted (Render/Railway/AWS).
> Localhost will NOT work during evaluation.

### Step 3 — Run the App

```bash
# Start Expo
npx expo start

# Or directly on Android
npx expo start --android

# Or on iOS
npx expo start --ios
```

Use the **Expo Go** app on your phone to scan the QR code.

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

### Staff Login (2-Step OTP)
1. Enter username + password → `POST /api/auth/login`
2. OTP sent to staff email
3. Enter OTP → `POST /api/auth/verify-otp`
4. JWT token stored in AsyncStorage

### Guest Login
1. Enter username + password → `POST /api/auth/client/login`
2. JWT token stored immediately

### Guest Register
→ `POST /api/auth/client/register`

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Change BASE_URL** in `src/config/api.js` before demo
2. Backend must be **live and deployed** — localhost not allowed
3. All students must be able to explain their module's code
4. The app uses JWT stored in AsyncStorage for protected routes
5. Pull-to-refresh is enabled on all list screens
